Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely. Who wants to brave the pouring rain. For a glass of French champagne?. Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by. And she was hot - as she kissed my mouth. She was hot - as I wiped her brow. She was hot - she pinned me to the ground. She was quick - she knew her way around. She was hot - as she tore my clothes. She was hot - she had no place to go. She was hot - on a cold and rainy night. Detroit was smoky grey. Nothing like the good old days. Well I got a fever that I'm fighting. I don't need your company. Leave me in my misery. I can take the rebound just like lightning. And she was hot - in a 50's dress. She was hot - her lips were flashing red. I was lost - in her burning flesh. I was hot - I was dripping sweat. She was hot - in the Detroit snow. She was hot - she had no place to go. She was hot - on a cold and rainy night. And she was hot - and I had the blues. She was hot - honey, where were you?. If you were in my shoes. You would be excused. She was hot - you can never wait. She was hot - never hesitate. She was hot - on a cold and rainy night. I think I'm going off the rails. Riding down the pleasure trails. I was taking passion where you find it. Honey when you were young and fresh. And you need the touch of your flesh. Go take the treasure where you find it. And she was hot - in the melted snow. She was hot - in the molten glow. She was hot - she got it in the blood. She was hot - like the dam that bursts. She was black - she was strong and true. She was black - and her eyes were blue. She was lost - and she took a chance. At just a brief romance. Down the avenue into the lost bayou. Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo. I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again. On a cold Chicago night. She was hot. She was hot. She was hot hot hot. She was hot hot hot.

album,Bridges To Babylon,1997,Already Over Me,As you poured out the drinks for me. I felt your hooks sink right into me. And I knew you were my destiny. And I thought you'd get the best of me. On the way down to Mexico. As I danced in yuor rodeo. You say poverty is picturesque. As you dragged your nails across my chest. You're so cold. You're so cruel. I'm your man. Not your fool. Are you already over me. Are you already over me. Are you already over me. What a fool I've been. In the first flush of ecstacy. As you lay naked next to me. While our love put the dawn to flight. I just ignore all those warning lights. Cause when you laugh. I just cry. When you left. I just died. Are you already over me. Are you already over me. Are you already sick me. What a fool I've been. Hard to hold on. To a love divine. I'm kneeling in a corner. Praying to your shrine. I've been hurt. So confused. I've been burned. I've been bruised. Are you already over me. Are you already over me. Are you already sick of me. Are you already over me. Are you already over me. Are you already tired of me. Are you already over me. What a fool I've been. What a fool I've been. What a fool I've been,anger,0.634421

album,A Bigger Bang,2005,Sweet Neo Con,"You call yourself a Christian . I think that you're a hypocrite . You say you are a patriot . I think that you're a crock of shit . And listen now, the gasoline . I drink it every day . But it's getting very pricey . And who is going to pay. How come you're so wrong . My sweet neo con....   Yeah . It's liberty for all . 'Cause democracy's our style . Unless you are against us . Then it's prison without trial . But one thing that is certain . Life is good at Haliburton . If you're really so astute . You should invest at Brown & Root.... Yeah . How come you're so wrong . My sweet neo con. If you turn out right . I'll eat my hat tonight . Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.... . It's getting very scary . Yes, I'm frightened out of my wits . There's bombers in my bedroom . Yeah and it's giving me the shits . We must have lots more bases . To protect us from our foes . Who needs these foolish friendships. We're going it alone . How come you're so wrong . My sweet neo con. Where's the money gone. In the Pentagon . Yeah ha ha ha . Yeah, well, well . Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... . Neo con",confident,0.856911
album,A Bigger Bang,2005,Look What The Cat Dragged In,"I know that you like to go out drinking . And you love to have a good time . You came in when I was drinking coffee . Having breakfast on a bad night . I won't interrogate you and I never will berate you . But your light's on . From where you've been . Lost weekend . What's that look on your face. It must have been the walk of shame . Your eyes are all red, get ready for bed . Your hair's all over the place . And look what the cat dragged in . Don't you call me a friend . Get out of my house with your dirty old mouth . Take yourself out again . Look what the cat dragged in . Yeah, you take it right out again . Yeah, look what the cat dragged in . Yeah, take it right out again . Looking at the sunday papers up what all the ladies did was so quiet . Checking what was going on in Syria and Lebanon . A bad pride, bad bribe . I'm going to criticize you and I hate to ostracize you . What a bad night . Where you've been. Lost weekend . You look like a tumble of spades . It must get a horrible taste . You look like a fucker, Sergeant Pepper . Are you going to throw up all over my face. Look what the cat dragged in . Take it right out again . Get out of my house with your dirty old mouth . Take it right out again . Look what the cat dragged in . Yeah, never do that my friend . Yeah, look what the cat dragged in . Look what the cat, look what the cat, look what the cat dragged in",confident,0.73611
album,A Bigger Bang,2005,Driving Too Fast,"You can follow the road to the mountain . Or the track leading down to the beach . You can go where your life go left or go right . It's you in the driver's seat . But if the rain starts swamping your windscreen . And the lights don't piss through the night . And the truck's coming at you, just going to splash you . The highway's blinding bright . You're going out of your brain, out of your mind  . You're so deranged, you're going blind . You're driving too fast . You went straight past the curve and you never go back . Driving too fast . The road was a blur and it all turned to black . Driving too fast . Hang on to the wheel, I think you're going to crash . You can see the freeway divided . It's a pity you can't take 'em both . One leads to the valley or down some blind alley . The other runs down to the coast . Too many roads lead to nowhere . But how they twist and they turn . And a dead end and a dusty old strip mall . Where your tires are all shredded and burned . You're going out of your brain, out of your mind . Going insane, you're going blind... Yeah . You're driving too fast . You slip through the curve and your slam through the flat . Driving too fast . Now you never go back . Driving too fast . Yeah and it's all time to pass, yeah. You're driving too fast . Hang on for your life, I think you're going to crash . You're going out of your brain, out of your mind  . You're so deranged, you're going blind . You're driving too fast . You slip pass the time, never go back . Driving too fast . You spin through the curve and you burn off the track . Driving too fast . You're running out of gas . Driving too fast . Hang on to the wheel, I think we're going to crash . Yeah . Driving too fast, Yeah...",sadness,0.542474

Oh why have you got it in for me. Things they are not what they seem . You're living in a nightmare baby . But I mistook it for a dream . Yeah just for a dream .
