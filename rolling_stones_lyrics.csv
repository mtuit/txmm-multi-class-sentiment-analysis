EP,The Rolling Stones,1964,Bye Bye Johnny,"Well she drew out all her money out from southern trust. And put a little boy aboard a Greyhound bus. Leaving Louisiana for the golden west. Down came her tears from her happiness. Her own little son named Johnny B Goode. Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode. Well, she remember taking money out from gathering crops. And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop. As long as he could play it by the railroad side. And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied. Never thought there'd ever come a day like this. When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode. Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of. Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love. As soon as he was married he would bring her back. And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks. And every time they heard the locomotive roar. They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode"
